    <h1>HOW TO MAKE A PAPER BOX</h1>
    <h2>Taking the time to creatively package a present shows the <br>
       recipient you put extra thought into their gift. And if <br>
       you learn how to fold a simple origami gift box, you'll <br>
       be able to make beautiful wrappings for a variety of <br>
       small gifts. The origami box featured in this quick and <br>
       easy tutorial is a traditional design known as a masu box. <br>
       A masu was originally a square box used to measure rice <br>
       in Japan, and today masu boxes are mostly used for <br>
       drinking sake. You can get festive with your box, <br>
       tailoring the colors and patterns of the paper to <br>
       holidays or the gift recipientâ€™s preferences. <br>
       Choose matching papers for the base and the lid, <br>
       or pick two colors or patterns that are slightly <br>
       different to add a bit of contrast to the project.<br>

    <p style="text-align: center;"  > 1: To begin the origami gift box, fold one sheet of paper in half horizontally. <br>
                                          Unfold it, and then fold it in half vertically. Unfold to reveal a <br>
                                          cross-crease pattern. Then, fold each corner into the center until <br>
                                          your paper looks like this model.<br>

    <p></p>


    <p style="text-align: center;" >2: Fold the top and bottom to the center of the paper as shown here. Unfold.

    <p></p>
    <p></p>

    <p style="text-align: center;" >3: Fold the left and right sides to the center of the paper.

    <p style="text-align: center;" >4: Open the two corners diagonal to each other, leaving the other <br>
                                       two corners folded. Use your forefingers to coax the corner folds <br>
                                       in, pulling the third edge upward. Tuck the top flap in to form <br>
                                       the side of the box. Repeat on the opposite side to complete the box<br>
                                        If you are planning to use the box to give a gift that is heavy, <br>
                                        secure the flaps with a glue stick or a bit of double-sided tape <br>
                                        for reinforcement.<br>

    <p style="text-align: center;" >5: Cut the second sheet of paper to measure approximately <br>
                                       11 1/2 inches by 11 1/2 inches. Then, repeat <br>
                                       steps 1 through 4 to fold a base for your origami <br>
                                       gift box.</p>
